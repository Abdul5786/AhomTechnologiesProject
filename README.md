The Signup API has been implemented successfully. It now checks for duplicate email entries, and in case of a duplicate, it appropriately throws an exception to ensure data integrity. Additionally, the project ensures that user passwords are securely stored in an encrypted form in the database, enhancing overall security measures.

 Login API with JWT Token: The Login API has been designed and implemented, incorporating JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure authentication. Users can now securely log in, and the JWT token ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.

Forget Password API with JavaMail Sender: integrated Java Mail Sender functionality. Now, when a user initiates a password reset, they will receive an email containing a secure link to reset their password.

 Custom Exception Handling:   To enhance the overall robustness of the project, custom exception handling has been implemented. This ensures that any unexpected scenarios are gracefully managed, providing a more reliable and stable user experience.

I have attached screenshots of the updated Forget Password functionality for your reference. These images provide a visual representation of the user interface and the steps involved in the password reset process.
